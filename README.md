##MEAN stack website with Angular 2

*Build with 'gulp'*
*Running in dev: 'mongod' in one terminal/cmd then 'set DEV_ENV=jr_company_site:&ast; & nodemon' in another*
**gulp will handle copying browser dependencies like (e.g., jquery, bootstrap) to /src**

*gulp process transpiles &ast;.ts to &ast;.js and uses **systemjs** to bundle as one ES5 JS file called bundle.js inside of /src*
